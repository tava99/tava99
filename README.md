## Hi there, I'm Antonio AntoniniðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“šI am a Master's degree student in Ingegneria Informatica e dell'Automazione with a strong passion for learning new programming languages. 
ðŸ’»I already have a good foundation in several languages, but I am always looking for opportunities to expand my skills and experiment with new technologies.
ðŸŒ±I firmly believe that versatility in the use of multiple languages is a key to tackling complex challenges and developing innovative solutions.

ðŸŽ¯Always ready to improve, I am motivated to explore new frontiers in computing and automation!
